# Phase 1: Data Collection to create corpus

The corpus was created from the scanned SC constituition books available on [HathiTrust Digital Library](https://www.hathitrust.org/) and [HeinOnline](https://heinonline.org/HOL/Welcome). Seventy digitized volumes of the Acts and Joint Resolutions of the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina from 1866 – 1958 were downloaded from HathiTrust Digital Library as JPEGs and OCR’ed text. The remaining thirty-two volumes were purchased as PDFs and OCR’ed text from HeinOnline.  

The South Carolina laws are divided up into *Acts or General laws* and *Joint Resolutions* also referred to as *Temporary Laws*. Following feedback from the Legal Scholars, the team decided to focus on the Acts and not the Joint Resolutions in the volumes.
