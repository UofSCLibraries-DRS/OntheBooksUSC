# OnTheBooks for UofSC
"On the Books" is a text mining project done jointly with University of North Carolina and University of Virginia, to identify Jim Crow/racial language in South Carolina constitution books containing "Acts and Joint Resolutions."  It is an extension of the [On the Books: Jim Crow and Algorithms of Resistance](https://onthebooks.lib.unc.edu/) project at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries-data/OnTheBooks) and funded by [Mellon Foundation](https://www.mellon.org/).

This page holds all major files related to the "On the Books" project at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/) as part of their [Digital Research Services](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/find_services/digital_research_services/index.php). This project was carried out in multiple phases as below:
### [Data collection](data)
### [Marginalia Removal](marginalia)
### [Sentence Splitting and Cleaning](sentence_splitting)
### [Classification](MachineLearning_OTB_USC)
### [Corpus Analysis](corpus_analysis)

More information about these phases can be found in the specific README.md files within those folders.

#### Static Views
Since Github might not display IPython notebooks nicely, atleast as of writing this README, a better and static view for this repository and its files (especially the IPython ones) can be found on [nbviewer's link](https://nbviewer.org/github/g-nitin/OnTheBooksUofSC/tree/main/) for this repository. Nbviewer does not host notebooks, it only renders notebooks available on other websites.
