# OnTheBooks for UofSC
"On the Books" project is a text mining project to identify Jim Crow/racial language in South Carolina constitution books containing "Acts and Joint Resolutions,", a joint project with University of North Carolina and University of Virginia. It is an extension of the OnTheBooks project at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries-data/OnTheBooks).

This page holds all major files related to the [OnTheBooks](https://onthebooks.lib.unc.edu/) project at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/) as part of their [Digital Research Services](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/find_services/digital_research_services/index.php). 

The project consisted of several phases:
- Marginalia Removal
- Sentence Splitting and Cleaning
- Classification
- Corpus Analysis

More information about these phases can be found in the specific README.md files within those folders.

## Static Views
Since Github might not display IPython notebooks nicely, atleast as of writing this README, a better and static view for this repository and its files (especially the IPython ones) can be found on [nbviewer's link](https://nbviewer.org/github/g-nitin/OnTheBooksUofSC/tree/main/) for this repository. Nbviewer does not host notebooks, it only renders notebooks available on other websites.
